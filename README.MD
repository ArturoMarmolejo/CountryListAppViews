* **Data:** Represents the country data.
* **Presentation:** Displays the list of countries using a `RecyclerView`.


## Libraries

* Kotlin Coroutines
* Retrofit
* RecyclerView
* Viewmodel
* Lifecycle
* Junit and Mockk for Unit Testing

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or device.

## Future improvements

* Implement a search feature to filter countries.
* Add detailed information screens for each country.
* Use a dependency injection framework like Dagger/Hilt.
* Implement a Domain Layer with use cases if we have more functionalities/repository methods to add
* Add SlidingPaneLayout in case we have a detail screen to display, for bigger devices
* Use Jetpack Navigation in case we have more screens to display
* Migrate to Jetpack Compose since it is the recommended approach for new applications
